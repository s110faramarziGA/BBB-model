# QSAR Model for Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability Prediction

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models and scripts to predict blood-brain barrier permeability using molecular fingerprints. The models include neural networks, support vector machines (SVMs), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). The implementation utilizes Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and Pandas.
