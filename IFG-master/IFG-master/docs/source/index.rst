Identify Functional Groups Docs
===============================

A python package for SMILES-based functional group identification. To begin using the python package for SMILES-based data collection and analysis, 
follow the :ref:`installation-ref`.

| View the :ref:`theory-overview-ref` and follow through the doc pages to learn about the computation details of the SMILES-based functional group identification process.

| View the :ref:`chem-package-ref` to learn about the SMILES-based python computation source modules of this package. 

| View the :ref:`ifg-scripts-ref` after the :ref:`installation-ref` to learn about and use the available SMILES-based data collection and analysis scripts of this package.

Please note that the documentation presented here is 
tentative and self-published by William Riddle, the developer 
of the project software, and remain unreviwed for the time being. 
Nevertheless, this documentation will assist anyone who
