IFG Installation
================

To install IFG for SMILES-based functional group data collection and data analysis, follow the steps below:

1. Install `git <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_
2. Install `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>`_
3. Clone the `github repository <https://github.com/wtriddle/IFG.git>`_ 

.. code-block::
    
    C:\> git clone https://github.com/wtriddle/IFG.git

4. Install the python packages required for IFG with poetry

.. code-block::
    
    C:\IFG> poetry install

5. Add the absolute IFG/ifg path to your system PYTHONPATH environemnt variable (example C:\IFG\ifg).
   See this `tutorial <https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/python-tutorial/python-path>`_ to set this up on your computer

You are now ready to use IFG!
View the :ref:`collection-script-ref` and the :ref:`analysis-script-ref` to collect and analyze functional group data from SMILES defined structures.
Please view the :ref:`smiles-code-support-ref` to see the types of SMILES code that IFG supports for functional group identification.
